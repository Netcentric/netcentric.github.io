We are proud to announce the release of a major version of the [Cognizant Netcentric FE Build](https://github.com/netcentric/fe-build/), an all-in-one solution for building modern frontend projects, with special focus on [AEM](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html) (Adobe Experience Manager).

The FE Build is a public [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@netcentric/fe-build) that can be integrated in any project running AEM in order to lint the source files, to compile [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and run [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) plugins on it (like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)), to transpile (and polyfill if needed) ECMAScript 2016+ code into ES5, and to automatically create [clientLibs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/developing/introduction/clientlibs.html?lang=en) from the source files to embed the optimized code.

If you want to start using the FE Build in your project, please follow the official guide üëâ [Netcentric/fe-build](https://github.com/Netcentric/fe-build).

## Breaking Changes

This release contains breaking changes. We know these can be disruptive, but they were needed to keep the dependencies updated.

[Stylelint v14](https://stylelint.io/migration-guide/to-14/) does not no longer includes the syntaxes that parse CSS-like languages like SCSS. You will need to install and configure these syntaxes in your project. We recommend extending a shared config like [@netcentric/stylelint-config](https://github.com/Netcentric/stylelint-config) that includes the appropriate syntax to lint SCSS.

### Migration Guide

First, install the shared config as a dependency:

```
npm install --save-dev @netcentric/stylelint-config
```

Then, update your [Stylelint configuration object](<(https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configure/)>) to use it:

```
{
  "extends": "@netcentric/stylelint-config",
  "rules": {
    ..
  }
}
```
