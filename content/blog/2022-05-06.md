We have released a major version of the Netcentric all-in-one solution for modern Frontend projects, with special focus on AEM.

Please read before upgrading your project:

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Stylelint v14 does not include syntaxes by default

Stylelint no longer includes the syntaxes to parse CSS-like languages like SCSS.

**Migration guide:**

- In your Stylelint configuration object extend a shared config like @netcentric/stylelint-config

### Features
