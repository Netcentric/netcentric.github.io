We have recently released a [new open source project](https://github.com/Netcentric/stylelint-config) for all those frontend heroes out there üéâ

At Netcentric we use [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to ensure code quality amongst all projects when it comes to writing CSS, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), or [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).

We have defined a set of rules as standards for all projects. Upon starting a new project the Tech Lead in charge of creating the frontend build will include this styling configuration. Hence, inheriting the Netcentric code style guidelines. And now, so can you!

If you don't know how, we've written a [Readme.md](https://github.com/Netcentric/stylelint-config/blob/main/README.md) for you to get started.
